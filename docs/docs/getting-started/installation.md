# Installation

DressingTools is a **standalone Unity UPM package** and **does not require any game or tool SDKs to be installed to work**.
Unless you are trying to integrate DressingTools generated cabinets into these games or tools.

This is useful for workflows that is **not related to VRChat at all**. For example, creating **VRM** projects, **ChilloutVR**, **MMD** or 
Unity projects that does not support VRCSDK at all.

### Dependencies

DressingTools depends on two external projects `DressingFramework` and `AvatarLib` currently.

## For VRChat

To integrate DressingTools with VRChat, **it is recommended to use VCC for installation** since it manages all libraries that
DressingTools require and the version of VRCSDK that we support.

### Via VCC (VRChat Creator Companion)

1. Install the VPM repository with the following button, or add the repository using `https://vpm.chocopoi.com/index.json` manually.
    <a
      className="button button--success button--lg"
      target="_self"
      href="vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvpm.chocopoi.com%2Findex.json">
      Install with VCC
    </a>

2. Press `I Understand, Add Repository` to add the repository.
