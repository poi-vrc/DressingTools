There are multiple choices that you can distribute your configurations with others:

### Distributing using prefabs

This is the probably the easiest and fastest way to let users to install your wearable.

Simply create your configuration as usual and create a new prefab by dragging the wearable into the Assets folder.

The user just have to [create a cabinet](/docs/getting-started/setup-cabinet) and drag your prefab to install.

### Distributing using configuration files

There might be some cases that the original prefab cannot be redistributed or publicized. 
You can make use of the import and export function to distribute your configuration.
