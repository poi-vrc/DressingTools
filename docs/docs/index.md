# Introduction

DressingTools<sup>2</sup> (DT2) is a **simple but advanced**, **non-destructive** and automated cabinet system. Dressing an avatar is **as simple as** either **one-click** from the tool window or drag-and-drop to the avatar root.

It also includes **advanced features** that allows you to customize the bone mappings, avatar/wearable toggles and blendshapes. But mostly this **can be automatically drafted for you within a wizard!**

By design, DressingTools is not a VRChat-only software and do not require neither DynamicsBones nor VRCSDK to be installed to work.

## Alpha stage

DressingTools<sup>2</sup> is currently in :warning: **alpha development stage** and lots of "dreamed" features are currently not completed. Feel free to try it but it is :warning: **currently usable, but unstable and feature-lacking**.

To keep track of development, the lacking features and issues will be marked in the the issue tracker, and assigned to a specific milestone of release.

These are the major features that DT2 aimed to have:

- VRCSDK and DynamicBones not required
- Cabinet system
- Animation generation for wearables
- Bone mapping preview and overriding
- Animator merging
- Mixing different clothes for toggling
- Sharable wearable configuration
- Centralized wearable configuration
