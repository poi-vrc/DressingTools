# Introduction

DressingTools<sup>2</sup> is a **simple but advanced**, **non-destructive** cabinet/wardrobe system. Dressing an avatar with multiple wearables is as simple as just one click!

It also includes **advanced features** that allows you to **customize the bone mappings for incompatible wearables**, **create your own wearable toggles and blendshapes controls**. This can be automatically drafted for you!

By design, DressingTools is portable and not a VRChat-only software. You can use it on newer Unity versions and other game projects without VRCSDK installed.
