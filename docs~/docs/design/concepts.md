# Concepts

DressingTools<sup>2</sup> is designed to decouple the v1 code as much as possible to enable high extensibility
and modular configuration.

As mentioned before, DressingTools is a standalone Unity UPM package. The internals do not require VRCSDK or other
toolkits to be installed to work. "VRChat" is called an integration and it is optionally required to be installed
for automatic build, animation, menu generation.
