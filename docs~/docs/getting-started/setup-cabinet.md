# Setup a cabinet

A cabinet saves our avatar-specific settings and presets. Your wearables work together with a cabinet to dress up your clothes organized.

### 1. Open the DressingTools<sup>2</sup> window

### 2. Create a cabinet

If you haven't created an cabinet before, it will probably show this screen at start. Drag your avatar that you are going to dress and press `Start` to create a new cabinet.

Otherwise, if you are setting up for another avatar in the same scene, you can also create a new cabinet by clicking this button:

## Behind the Scenes

### Creating cabinet

When you create a cabinet, a `DT Cabinet` component is added to the avatar root. It internally stores your avatar-specific settings
and presets that help you to save time dressing up different wearables later on.
