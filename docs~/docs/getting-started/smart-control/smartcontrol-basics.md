# Smart Control Basics

Create your animations to toggle objects or components on and off, or changing blendshape, component, shader properties etc.!

## Control types

The control type determines how you want the objects to be controlled. Currently, there are two types of control implemented.

### Binary

As the name suggests, this type of control only has two states: off (0) and on (1), controlled by a boolean parameter.

**Use cases:** Toggling objects and components on and off, changing blendshapes, shaders and properties to a specific value etc.

    className="button button--success button--lg"
    target="_self"

</a>

### Motion Time

This creates an animation with its play time controlled by a float parameter.

**Use cases:** Controlling blendshapes, shaders and properties with a radial item dynamically etc.
